# `question/`
`question/` is a directory to record the research question and the background to reach the question.

## `question.md`
`hypothesis.md` is a file to write a question in a word.

## `background.tex`
`background.tex` is a file to recode what motive you to come up with the question. Any information helpful to understand the motivation is fine. If the question is driven by any previous works, it will be nice to write down the overview of the works and why they motivate you to study the question.

## `ref.bib`
literatures for `background.tex`.
